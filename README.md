# 📊 Simple Stock Portfolio Tracker (Python)

A lightweight, beginner-friendly **console-based stock portfolio tracker** written in Python. This tool uses **hardcoded stock prices** for a few popular companies and allows users to input stock symbols and quantities to calculate their total investment value.

This project demonstrates core programming concepts such as **loops, dictionaries, user input handling, validation, data processing**, and **basic file export** operations. Ideal for beginners learning Python fundamentals.

## ✨ Features

* 💲 **Predefined stock prices** for five major companies (AAPL, TSLA, GOOGL, MSFT, AMZN)
* 🧮 **Calculates total portfolio value** based on user input
* 📝 **Option to save results** as `.txt` or `.csv`
* ⛔ **Validation for incorrect stock symbols and quantities**
* 🔁 **Loop-based data entry until user types ‘done’**
* 📦 **Simple, clean, console-based workflow**

---

## 📁 File Included

* **Hardcoded stock prices.py** — Main script containing:

  * Hardcoded stock price dictionary
  * Input-driven portfolio builder
  * Total investment calculator
  * File-saving functionality

## 📝 Example Console Session

```
=== Simple Stock Portfolio Tracker ===
Available stocks: AAPL, TSLA, GOOGL, MSFT, AMZN
Type 'done' when finished.

Enter stock symbol: AAPL
Enter quantity for AAPL: 5

Enter stock symbol: MSFT
Enter quantity for MSFT: 2

Enter stock symbol: done

Calculating investment...

AAPL: 5 shares x $180 = $900
MSFT: 2 shares x $320 = $640

Total Portfolio Value = 1540
```
